## Project Architecture

The codebase is organized with a clear separation of concerns, making it modular and maintainable.
- **`js/components/`**: Contains all the reusable Vue components that make up the UI.
- **`js/stores/`**: Manages all application state using Pinia, with dedicated modules for notes, tags, and settings.
- **`js/services/`**: Handles all business logic, side effects, and communication with browser APIs (IndexedDB, AI services, etc.).
- **`styles/`**: Contains all CSS, organized into global styles, a theme file (for light/dark mode), and component-specific stylesheets.
